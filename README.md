# Traffic simulator

A side project to build a traffic simulator in my spare time.

__Note that this project is *not* complete and *not* useful. Do not expect to see anything of value here for some time.__

## What is it?

I've always wanted to build a realistic 'traffic simulator'. Essentially agents which drive vehicles within a changeable field. I want to play with creating things like traffic obstacles, traffic lights, speed limits, junction designs, etc, and see what behavior emerges. So, here we are. This is my *procrastination project* :-)

## How is it built?

It's a simple HTML5 Canvas based JavaScript app designed to run in the browser. As few external dependencies as possible for now.

## How you can get involved

This is my 'for fun' side project but I'm happy to take input, advice (especially if I'm doing something in a stupid way), or even pull requests if they're not substantially changing what I'm trying to do. Feel free to reach out or raise an issue.

## TODOs

Essentially everything is left TODO, but:

* ~~Create canvas~~
* ~~Basic rendering loop~~
* ~~Initial Car model~~
* Create a more general Vehicle model
* Create other vehicle types with their own characteristics (trucks, buses, maybe even bikes)
* Create street furniture
* Come up with a way to paint or define a road system
* .. lots more to think about
